### Descrição

<p align="justify">
"This is a fascinating book. It's been almost 20 years since Abelson and Sussman revolutionized the teaching of computer science with their Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. In all that time, there have been several books (some of them quite good) following SICP's ideas pretty closely, and of course many books following the old pedagogy in which the details of a programming language are the focus, with few deep ideas. But this is the first book I've seen that focuses on big ideas and multiple paradigms, as SICP does, but chooses a very different core model (declarative programming) the first real intellectual competition to Abelson and Sussman. I wouldn't have made all the choices Van Roy and Haridi have made, but I learned a lot from reading this book, and I hope it gets a wide audience." --Brian Harvey, Lecturer, Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley </p>

" Types are the leaven of computer programming; they make it digestible. This excellent book uses types to navigate the rich variety of programming languages, bringing a new kind of unity to their usage, theory, and implementation. Its author writes with the authority of experience in all three of these aspects." --Robin Milner, Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge

### Descrição

<p align="justify">
 Programming Language Pragmatics, Fourth Edition, is the most comprehensive programming language textbook available today. It is distinguished and acclaimed for its integrated treatment of language design and implementation, with an emphasis on the fundamental tradeoffs that continue to drive software development.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The book provides readers with a solid foundation in the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the full range of programming languages, from traditional languages like C to the latest in functional, scripting, and object-oriented programming.  This fourth edition has been heavily revised throughout, with expanded coverage of type systems and functional programming, a unified treatment of polymorphism, highlights of the newest language standards, and examples featuring the ARM and x86 64-bit architectures.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Updated coverage of the latest developments in programming language design, including C & C++11, Java 8, C# 5, Scala, Go, Swift, Python 3, and HTML 5</li>
    <li>Updated treatment of functional programming, with extensive coverage of OCaml</li>
    <li>New chapters devoted to type systems and composite types</li>
    <li>Unified and updated treatment of polymorphism in all its forms</li>
    <li>New examples featuring the ARM and x86 64-bit architectures</li>
</ul>
