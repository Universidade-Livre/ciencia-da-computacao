### Descrição

<p align="justify">
This book fills a need for a thorough introduction to graph theory that features both the understanding and writing of proofs about graphs. Verification that algorithms work is emphasized more than their complexity. An effective use of examples, and huge number of interesting exercises, demonstrate the topics of trees and distance, matchings and factors, connectivity and paths, graph coloring, edges and cycles, and planar graphs. For those who need to learn to make coherent arguments in the fields of mathematics and computer science.

### Descrição

<p align="justify">
This standard textbook on modern graph theory combines the authority of a classic with the engaging freshness of style that is the hallmark of active mathematics. It covers the core material of the subject, with concise yet complete proofs, while offering glimpses of more advanced methods in each field via one or two deeper results.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This is a major new edition. Among many other improvements, it offers additional tools for applying the regularity lemma, brings the tangle theory of graph minors up to the cutting edge of current research, and addresses new topics such as chi-boundedness in perfect graph theory.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The book can be used as a reliable text for an introductory graduate course and is also suitable for self-study.

### Descrição

<p align="justify">
Graph theory is a flourishing discipline containing a body of beautiful and powerful theorems of wide applicability. Its explosive growth in recent years is mainly due to its role as an essential structure underpinning modern applied mathematics – computer science, combinatorial optimization, and operations research in particular – but also to its increasing application in the more applied sciences. The versatility of graphs makes them indispensable tools in the design and analysis of communication networks, for instance.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The primary aim of this book is to present a coherent introduction to the subject, suitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics and computer science. It provides a systematic treatment of the theory of graphs without sacrificing its intuitive and aesthetic appeal. Commonly used proof techniques are described and illustrated, and a wealth of exercises - of varying levels of difficulty - are provided tohelp the reader master the techniques and reinforce their grasp of the material.
</p>

<p align="justify">
A second objective is to serve as an introduction to research in graph theory. To this end, sections on more advanced topics are included, and a number of interesting and challenging open problems are highlighted and discussed in some detail. Despite this more advanced material, the book has been organized in such a way that an introductory course on graph theory can be based on the first few sections of selected chapters.
